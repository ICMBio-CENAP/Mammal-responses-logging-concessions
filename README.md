# Mammal-responses-logging-concessions

Data and code to run the Bayesian Multi-species Occupancy Model (MSOM) used in the paper "Mammal responses to reduced-impact logging in Amazonian forest concessions" by Carvalho Jr et al.

### Description

The *data_jamari* file contains the data for the analysis. This include camera-trap data (species detection histories) and site and sampling covariates in the format required by the analysis code.

The *analysis_code* file has the code to run the Bayesian multi-species occupancy model. This code was adapted from a template written by Elise Zipkin and available at the Github page of the [Zipkin Quantitative Ecology Lab](https://github.com/zipkinlab/Community_model_examples-covariate_model/blob/master/covariate%20model%20code.r)
